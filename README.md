# Reproducibility Guide — MSR 2026 Mining Challenge

This document provides a complete, step-by-step guide to reproducing all analyses presented in our MSR 2026 Mining Challenge submission.  
It covers environment setup, dataset access, notebook execution, and expected outputs.

---

# 📦 1. Environment Setup

We provide a full Conda environment specification.

### **Create the environment**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ai-dev-msr
```

### **Verify installation**
```python
python -c "import pandas, pyarrow, sklearn; print('Environment OK')"
```

# 2. Repository Structure

The project follows a research-oriented structure to ensure full reproducibility.
Below is the complete directory layout used in our MSR 2026 Mining Challenge submission:

```commandline

```

# 3. Dataset Access

We use the AIDev dataset from the MSR 2026 Mining Challenge.  
All data is accessed programmatically from HuggingFace; no manual download is required.

To load the dataset:
- Use Python’s `pandas.read_parquet` with the provided HuggingFace paths.
- All raw files are stored in `data/raw/` only when `preprocess.py` is run with the caching flag.

# 4. Running the Notebooks

All experiments were executed using Jupyter Lab.  
Each notebook contains a fully self-contained workflow including:
- Data loading
- Data processing and cleaning
- Analysis and visualization
- Export of reproducible results to the `results/` directory

To run the notebooks:
1. Start the environment using `conda activate ai-dev-msr`
2. Launch Jupyter Lab with `jupyter lab`
3. Open and run the notebooks in the following order:
   - `RQ1_testing_behavior.ipynb`
   - `RQ2_review_dynamics.ipynb`
   - `RQ3_acceptance_prediction.ipynb`

# 5. Expected Outputs

Running the notebooks generates all required output files for reproduction.

Tables saved to `results/tables/`:
- `rq1_testing_summary.csv`
- `rq2_comment_categories.csv`
- `rq3_feature_importance.csv`

Figures saved to `results/figures/`:
- `test_presence_by_agent.png`
- `comment_type_distribution.png`
- `acceptance_feature_correlations.png`

These outputs correspond exactly to the tables and figures used in our MSR 2026 submission.

# 6. Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **HuggingFace parquet loading error**  
  Ensure the following packages are updated: `huggingface_hub`, `fsspec`.

- **Notebook kernel crash**  
  Increase the Jupyter I/O buffer limit.

- **Out-of-memory error during loading**  
  Load specific columns using the `columns=[...]` argument.

- **Missing result files**  
  Re-run the final cell of each notebook; figures and tables are saved automatically.

# 7. Citation Instructions

# 8. Reproducibility Checklist

- [ ] Conda environment created using `environment.yml`
- [ ] All notebooks executed sequentially
- [ ] Output tables generated in `results/tables/`
- [ ] Output figures generated in `results/figures/`
- [ ] Results match those reported in the MSR 2026 paper
