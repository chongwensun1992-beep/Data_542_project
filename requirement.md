# MSR 2026 Mining Challenge — Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
- **Conference:** MSR 2026 — The 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories  
- **Location & Dates:** Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — April 13–14, 2026 (co-located with ICSE 2026)  
- **Track:** Mining Challenge  
- **URL:** https://2026.msrconf.org/track/msr-2026-mining-challenge

The MSR Mining Challenge invites participants to analyze a curated dataset to uncover new insights, trends, and empirical evidence related to software engineering practice.

---

## 2. Dataset: AIDev
- The 2026 Challenge dataset is **AIDev**, a large-scale dataset containing **agent-authored pull requests (PRs)** from real-world GitHub repositories.
- Participants may explore research questions related to PR acceptance, agent/human collaboration, code quality, review dynamics, defect patterns, risks, and more.
- The submission must clearly indicate the **dataset version or snapshot** used to ensure reproducibility.

## 3. Submission Requirements (Challenge Paper)

### 3.1 Paper Format
- **Type:** Challenge Paper (short)
- **Length:** Maximum **4 pages**, plus **1 page for references**
- **Template:** ACM conference format. LaTeX recommended:
- **Review Process:** Double-blind (anonymous).  
- No author names or affiliations  
- Self-citations must use third-person phrasing  

### 3.2 Required Content
A valid Challenge Paper must include:

1. **Motivation and problem definition**
2. **Dataset description** (including version or snapshot used)
3. **Methods / approach / tools**
4. **Results and key findings**
5. **Discussion and implications**
6. **If external data is used (BYOD):**
 - Must be publicly accessible  
 - Must disclose source and license  
 - Must comply with Open Science and ethical-use policies  

### 3.3 Open Science Recommendations
Participants are strongly encouraged to release:
- Data processing / cleaning scripts  
- Analysis scripts  
- Derived datasets (anonymized if necessary)  
- Reproduction instructions  

Using GitHub + Zenodo/Figshare is recommended.

## 5. Review, Publication, and Open Access
- Accepted papers will appear in the **ACM Digital Library** as part of MSR 2026.
- Starting in 2026, ACM publications become **Open Access** by default.
- Authors from ACM Open institutions do not pay APCs; others may apply for waivers.

---

## 6. Awards
The track includes a **Best Mining Challenge Paper Award**.

Submissions with strong empirical rigor and good Open Science artifacts (open code, reproducible workflows) have higher chances to win.

---

## 7. Submitting a Dataset (Challenge Proposal)

If you want your dataset to become a future Mining Challenge dataset, you may submit a **Challenge Proposal**.

### Required Elements:
1. Dataset title  
2. Short description  
3. Data structure / schema  
4. Access method  
5. Example research questions  
6. Link to sample data (GitHub / Zenodo / Figshare)

### Challenge Proposal Deadlines:
- **Submission:** August 20, 2025  
- **Notification:** August 28, 2025  

Accepted datasets become the official dataset of a future Challenge, and authors join the MSR Challenge program committee.

## 8. Best Practices & Notes
- Clearly specify which dataset snapshot/version is used.
- Ensure analyses and findings are reproducible.
- If using external data, ensure legality and proper attribution.
- Avoid dual submissions (cannot submit the same paper elsewhere).
- Anonymize sensitive data and follow responsible disclosure guidelines.
